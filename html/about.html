                The Leela story begins with the opening of The Leela Mumbai in 1986, when its founder Late Captain C P
                Krishnan Nair, at the age of 65 years started to build the The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts.<br>
                <br>

                The success of The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts surprised everyone but Captain C P Krishnan Nair
                himself. No stranger to humble beginnings, and boundless ambition, Captain Nair was a man known for
                transforming his own circumstances, and those of the people who worked with him. His long and diverse
                career saw him move from an ordinary citizen to a respected army officer, and from a successful textile
                exporter to one of the leading hoteliers of the world. <br> <br>

                Today, The Leela is owned by Brookfield Asset Management, a leading global alternative asset manager
                with over $625 billion in assets under management, as well as a 120-year history of owning and operating
                high quality assets.<br> <br>

                Under the Brookfield ownership, The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts is a pure play luxury brand, well
                poised to embrace the next new phase in its growth trajectory.

                Some journeys can be summed up in a photo, a tweet, a souvenir. But others are so filled with inner
                riches, they defy easy description. For our guests, this has always posed a challenge: How to best
                capture the world of luxury that is The Leela? For one visitor, it’s a lobby – and a welcome that makes
                her feel like royalty. For another, it’s discovering a hidden garden, guided only by the scent of
                jasmine. To some, it is small touches that few others notice – the warmth of a gesture, the extra care
                in the simplest dish. Finding the right words for this distinctly Indian luxury brand is made all the
                more difficult because it is constantly being refined and enhanced. <br> <br>

                From the start, we have been on a continuous journey to delight each traveller who crosses our
                threshold. It is The Leela’s goal to provide the most demanding guests with memorable, magical stays
                that deliver the essence of India and allow them to discover a true Indian luxury experience found only
                in India, and only at The Leela. <br>

                In a span of over three decades, The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts has grown to comprise a
                world-class collection of ten award-winning luxury hotels spread across key destinations in India with
                many more on the anvil. These include the flagship hotel in the capital city of New Delhi, Bengaluru,
                Chennai, Udaipur, Jaipur, Gurugram, East Delhi, Goa, Mumbai and now Gandhinagar. Each hotel celebrates
                its unique location, art, culture and cuisine with thoughtful services, celebratory rituals and
                immersive experiences to curate distinctive experiences that captivate the hearts of the most discerning
                global travellers.
